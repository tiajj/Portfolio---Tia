The corpus I chose to be represented in my final assignment is a comparison of rock music from the 80s, 90s and 2000s. The rock genre is my favourite across the decades and looking into what ties them together and sets them apart is interesting to me. The total corpus includes 90 tracks, with 30 from each decade.
The scatter plot I made for this assignment is divided into three sections, one for each decade, with the Danceability variable on the y-axis and the Valence variable on te x-axis. I was interested to see if the valence of a song made it more danceable. 
Other variables measured in this scatter plot are Track Popularity, measured by color, where a track is considered "Very" popular if it measured superior to 75, and "Little" popular if it measured inferior to 75. I also measured loudness, which I found interesting to look into for rock music, and that variable is measured by size.
From the plot, I can see that 00s rock is louder than both other decades, which was interesting to find out, but not surprising. Valence and Dancebaility don't affect track popularity, and if valence and dasnecability have an effect on one another, it can't be seen from a quick visualisation and would need to be looked into further.
